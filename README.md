# Corosuke Protocol

## Overview

The **Corosuke Protocol** is an innovative payment gateway designed to enhance transactions within the Core DAO ecosystem. By bridging Core DAO’s blockchain technology with Bitcoin transactions, Corosuke Protocol provides a secure, efficient, and scalable solution for handling digital payments. It supports transactions using CORE, coreBTC, and stCORE tokens and integrates ANON AADHAR for added security and identity verification.

## Key Features

- **Seamless Transactions**: Facilitates payments within the Core DAO ecosystem using CORE, coreBTC, and stCORE tokens.
- **Enhanced Security**: Incorporates ANON AADHAR for robust KYC and DID (Decentralized Identity) verification.
- **Efficient Payments**: Reduces gas fees and accelerates transaction speeds compared to native Bitcoin transactions.
- **Developer-Friendly SDK**: Provides an easy-to-integrate SDK for developers to incorporate payment functionalities into their dApps.

## Problem Statement

Bitcoin transactions are often hindered by high gas fees and slow processing times. Traditional payment systems face challenges in scalability, security, and cost-effectiveness. Corosuke Protocol addresses these issues by leveraging Core DAO’s infrastructure to provide a more efficient, lower-cost solution while enhancing security with advanced verification methods.

## Solution

Corosuke Protocol offers a streamlined payment gateway that minimizes gas fees and accelerates transaction speeds. By utilizing Core DAO’s hybrid Satoshi Plus consensus mechanism, it overcomes the limitations of traditional Bitcoin transactions. The integration of ANON AADHAR adds an extra layer of security and compliance, ensuring that every transaction is secure and verifiable.

## How It Works
